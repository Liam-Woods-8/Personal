        <h2>Python Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Python was the first language I learned at Syracuse University, and I
          immediately fell in love with its simplicity. I explored it for
          personal projects, including my favorite: the snake game.

        <h2>HTML/CSS Learning</h2>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS allow me to express creativity through web design. I am
          currently refining my skills through class projects and personal
          website work.

        <h2>JavaScript Journey</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript was the language that convinced me to pursue a coding
          career. I am excited to build dynamic web applications with it.
